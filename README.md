## Questions

1. What was your approach for this project? Did it change as you developed the app further?

My work began with developing a new app using the `create-react-app` command. Next, I made and followed a proper folder structure and installed the required packages. The second step involved working on user modules followed by a display of user lists on different URLs.
Finally, I added the View and Edit option in the user list for each user. These features allowed them to see and edit their profile anytime.

There were no such changes in the existing approach.

2. What were the challenges you faced?

I did not face any such challenges because I was familiar with all the tasks.

3. How differently will you do if you had a couple of more days to complete the assignment? What if you have one full month?

I'll do the following changes:

- Add the Typescript for compile-time checking
- Design UI
- Create the authentication management
- Create the backend API
- Add the test cases
- Create responsive design
